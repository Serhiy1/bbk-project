== 1. abstract

- Designing a platform for sharing information between multiple parties in a manner that is secure and provides provenance and reliability
// Change line, copied and pasted
- The report will describe the development process of this project, its design, technical decisions, and architecture.  


== 2. Introduction

[discrete]
=== Problem statement
* Mention how the world is changing, with companies introducing more automation
* This automation requires the quick transfer of information between parties
* A problem arises when the data cannot be trusted and needs to be verified
** Note: Add all the issues with untrusted data here. 
** Note: Data can come in all shapes and forms but must be trusted. A manufacturing corp could need to trust an invoice document while a newspaper   needs to trust a photo is not AI-generated  
** Fake: Fake invoices, faked images
** He said / she said fights

* This is currently rectified with manual process checks, and a "shadow IT." department emerges
* This problem undoes all the benefits of automation 

High-level description of my solution: 
* Create an API-first SASS service for sharing data 
* Data Needs to be shared securely and in a structured manner
* Note the need for cryptographic assurance. Mention SCITT, Merkle trees, and smart contracts. 
** But this is beyond the scope of the uni project

== 4 Requirements

//  Copied and pasted need to update 
=== 4.1 Functional
Requirement 1: Users should be able to sign up.
Requirement 2: Users should be able to log events into the system.
Requirement 3: Users should be able to share logged events with users on the system.
//  This one is shit, make it better  
Requirement 4: Users should be able to create additional application users to make integration easier

// Additional ones that I may want to add
// 1. Attaching rich information to events 
// 2. Some kind of verification system with hashes? 


=== 4.2 Non Functional 

NFR1: High Availability.
1. System design should be fault-tolerant.
2. The system should appear as always available.

NFR2: Low latency.
1. Chat messages must be sent between participating peers in real-time.

NFR3: Maintainability
1. The system should be designed in a way that is easy to maintain.
2. The system should be designed to develop each component independently.

NFR4: Scalability
1. The system should be horizontally scalable on demand.

NFR5: Security.
1. Data transmitted over the Blitzshare network should be secure and protected.

=== 4.3 Use cases and designs

1. Diagram for signing up 
* This will be first a password + email token exchange.  
2. Diagram for making an application registration 
3. Diagram for setting up Project
4. Diagram for inviting collaborators
5. Diagram for logging events on a project - and collaborators also receiving same event
